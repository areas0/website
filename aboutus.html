                    <p>Computer science has always been a passion for me even before EPITA. I have learned by myself a little bit of some programming languages and got the opportunity to work with a small team for server software development in C# and node-JavaScript (known as node-js). I got in touch with various developers and discovered the world of software development with them. </p>
                    <p>However, I have no experience with Unity. Therefore, I aim with this project, to learn how to make a game with the help of the rest of the team. Furthermore, I see this project as an opportunity to expand my skills in sound environment and music-making. 
                      As the project leader, I will put my organization skills at test during this semester to make this project a reality and fulfill our objectives.</p>
                    <p>Finally, as a future engineer, this project is an opportunity to learn how to make a team work.</p>

                    <p>Ever since in highschool I started developing games and applications and thus have a solid experience in softwares like Unity and Visual Studio but also with languages such as C#, Python and Java. </p>
                    <P>So, I was very excited to start working on the project and I think I can help my team by sharing my knowledge and my passion. I am someone very passionate and I tend to work very fast if the subject interest me. As we decided on this game idea together I am very excited to start working on this project with my team members.</P>
                    <P>But although I have been coding for a long time, I have never participated in a group project that big. This experience will teach me how to work in a group and will also push me to finish a game in its entirety from programming to graphics.</P>
                    <P>Being a lazy person this will also force me to work and to do my best in a limited amount of time. As I am not working alone anymore i will have to finish my part of the project before the deadline (and not 1 day before) to ensure that my teammates can work properly without worrying about me.</P>

                    <p>I always loved computer sciences but I never actually learned to code before coming to EPITA, even if in one semester I learned a lot. </p>
                    <p>However, I already did some projects in SI (high school) and with a innovation group with whom I had the opportunity to present projects to different competitions like the “Concours Lépine”. Thanks to those experiences, I know how to work with a team and to present project but this experience is another opportunity to improve those skills.</p>
                    <p>This project will also allow me to develop better coding skills, to learn how to do 3D modeling and to use different kind of software. In addition to that, everything that I will learn during this project is going to be useful for what I might do later as an engineer. That is why I look forward to learn how to create a video game with my team because I know we can learn a lot from each other.</p>

                    <p>I discovered computer science in highschool through a programming class called ”Informatique et création numérique”. We were taught how to code on Processing. Then, at
                      the end of my senior year, our maths teacher made us try our hand at coding in Python.
                      I therefore had very little experience in programming before joining EPITA.
                      I expect, through this project, to learn how to use Unity and Blender, gain experience in
                      teamwork surrounding a game, as well as learn more about all the different steps related
                      to the making of a video game.
